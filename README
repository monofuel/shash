Programming assignment #2
Shash
monofuel
CS5950

shell that restricts user command execution to a set of binaries
specified via SHA1 sum.

log all commands to be audited by admin

.shash.config secifies:
	the fully qualified name of all binaries that can be executed
	the sha1 sum the binary must have
	the environment in which each binary must be executed

	no blank lines
	one or more environment descriptions
		environment specification
		set of strings that compromises a process' environment
		followed by command specification
		one or more lines containing one element
		of the environment under which the binary must execute
		each line contains a variable definition followed
		by a newline or EOF and has no preceding or following whitespace
		the string EMPTY is a sntinel value that the environment
		should be empty
	command specification containing lines describing the binaries that
	will execute under the preceding environment
		contains a sentinel character, a name, and a SHA1 sum
		contain * as the first character followed by spaces or tabs
		followed by the fully qualified name of a binary, followed
		by a variable number of whitespace, followed by  a sha1 sum,
		followed by whitespace, followed by a newline or EOF.
	.shash.config should not be writable by group or world. if it is,
	exit silently with respect to stdout.

on start:
	clear the environment
	read the config
		create log entry if there is an error processing the config
		log the real and effective UIDs,GIDs,time,date,controlling terminal, and problem
		with the config to .shashLog in the current directory
	user may then invoke commands using either the fully qualified name or an unqualified command
	prior to executing the user's commands, the shell will:
		determine that the named command is in the set of allowed commands
		if the command is not contained, silently refuse to execute it.
	ensure that a sha1 sum run over binary matches config
		if they don't match, silently refuse.
	create the command environment
	log the real and effective UIDs,GIDs,time,date,controlling terminal,command entered, and
	created environment(s) to .shashLog in the current directory
	execute the command using execve, passing the created environment
		log an error return from execve with the error code and the
		time,date, and command logged prior to execution
a silent exit should include the message "Silent Exit" being emitted to stdout
shell must handle a single pipe.
q and quit should cause shell to terminate
